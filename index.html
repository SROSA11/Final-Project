            <p><span style="font-size: larger;"> 
            I'm Steve, I have a positive attitude and a passion for things that make me think.   
            I am currently the Sales Operations Manager in the Atlanta region.
            I have been with the company for 9 years, starting with the Ford Credit Leadership Development Program in the Nashville Business Center!
            I have had the opportunity to work in Customer Service, Origination's, Dealer Credit, and also as a Team Leader. 
            My various roles have provided a strong background in understanding our business operations.        
            I continue to look for ways to improve on our processes as well as improving myself.
            I find learning new skills and challenging myself to be rewarding.
            I'm gritty and I believe in my abilities and competencies to understand complex subjects.
            I graduated from Clemson University earning a B.S. in Financial Management, with an emphasis on portfolio management.
            In my free time I enjoy researching and investing.
            I enjoy mentally stimulating activities and believe pursuing a new skillset is an exciting opportunity. 
            Additionally, I have the mental toughness to persevere and remain optimistic, along with humility to ask for help and seek guidance when needed.

            I want to be a software engineer because I see the endless possibilities to create new and exciting products.
            I see it as a vehicle for the future and the future for our vehicles. 
            I enjoy the process of problem solving and building tools in my current role, and look to apply those skills to software engineering.
            As a perpetual learner, the "Learn to Code" program is a unique opportunity to build a new set of skills while continuing to learn and develop within the company.
            I believe my knowledge and background of sales and finance with additional skills in programming will lead to innovative changes for 
            Ford Credit.
