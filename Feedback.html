        <h1>Feedback!</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone loves a bit of constructive criticism!  
            Once the “Profile” page and the “Recipe” pages were created I decided to share the website for feedback to make revisions. 
            I went through several iterations of the website and worked diligently to make the site complete before sharing. 
            I was satisfied with what I created but thought it could use some improvements. 
            After emailing it out to friends, family, and peers I was provided with a ton of suggestions!
        </p>
        <p>
            On the Recipe page, the sizing and spacing of the pictures needed more consistency and definition. Also, the instructions made sense to me, but would they make sense to everyone?  
            I sought out my friend's mom for advice, she is a Speech-Language Pathologist and went through my site with a fine tooth comb to ensure grammatical accuracy!
            My sister, who helped me cook the gnocchi, reviewed the instructions just as meticulously.

            Additionally, while taking a look on her lunch break at work, my Mom shared it with the all the nurses in her OBGYN unit to provide suggestions! The more the merrier!

        </p>
        
        <p>
            I also sent the website to my boss for feedback. 
            She is a great advocate and strategic thinker who helped me to see it from a new perspective. 
            My friends and family know my passion for cooking and creating difficult yet delicious meals, so making a recipe was natural.
            The profile page was more professional and didn't mention cooking in the first drafts. 
            I was encouraged to share more about me personally to help connect the dots and make the site more cohesive.

            Feel free to let me know what you would improve!
